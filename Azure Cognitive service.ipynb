      "1.  INTRODUCTION  \n",
      "\n",
      "Information Security is the preservation of the following 3 characteristics of information: \n",
      "\n",
      "• Confidentiality – ensuring that information is accessible only to those authorized to have \n",
      "access. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Integrity – safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of information and its associated \n",
      "processing methods. This refers to protection against unauthorized modification. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Availability – ensuring that authorized users have access to information and associated \n",
      "processing systems when required. \n",
      "\n",
      "This policy specifies the requirements needed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability \n",
      "of Sterling Bank’s information resources. \n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, when information is transmitted or communicated, the following security principles also \n",
      "need to be complied with: \n",
      "\n",
      "• Authentication/Identification – ensuring that the identity of the user/entity can be positively \n",
      "verified. \n",
      "\n",
      "• Non-repudiation – ensuring that the sender and/or recipient cannot deny sending or receiving \n",
      "the information concerned. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.1  THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMATION RESOURCES TO STERLING BANK \n",
      "\n",
      "Information resources are vital assets of Sterling Bank, as vital as the Bank’s other business assets.  \n",
      "Information resource is the lifeblood of the Bank and shall therefore be adequately protected against \n",
      "all risks. The protection of Sterling’s information resources is critical to Sterling Bank’s continuity. \n",
      "\n",
      "1.2 WHY STERLING BANK NEEDS INFORMATION SECURITY? \n",
      "\n",
      "       As stated above, Sterling Bank’s information resources are critical to its survival.  Sterling Bank shall \n",
      "therefore ensure that such information resources are adequately protected when used by all parties \n",
      "authorized to have access to these resources. However, for Sterling Bank to be a competitive player \n",
      "in the market, Sterling Bank shall also share such information resources with other external parties \n",
      "such as customers, vendors and financial institutions. This reduces the risk that vital Sterling Bank \n",
      "assets will be compromised to the detriment of the organization. \n",
      "\n",
      "To protect Sterling Bank’s information resources during internal and external use, in addition to \n",
      "conforming to statutory and contractual requirements regarding its information, Information Security \n",
      "is one of Sterling Bank’s prime responsibilities in order to protect and secure these vital assets. This \n",
      "responsibility is shared by all employees of Sterling Bank. \n",

      "\n",
      "Information in all its forms, including information about employees, customers and products, are \n",
      "amongst the most valuable assets of the Bank. The security (confidentiality, integrity and availability) \n",
      "of that information is key to Sterling Bank’s successful discharging of its responsibilities to customers \n",
      "and stakeholders. Therefore, the security of Sterling Bank’s information, the systems and programs \n",
      "that facilitate its use is a responsibility shared by every employee of the Bank. Every employee of \n",
      "Sterling Bank and extensions of these employees have an obligation to ensure the confidentiality, \n",
      "integrity and availability of Sterling Bank’s information resources.   \n",
      "\n",
      "Management is primarily responsible for implementing controls throughout the organisation, in line \n",
      "with corporate governance tenets. Management realises the strategic importance of Information \n",

      "for the enforcement of all aspects of Information Security on a corporate level as well as that of every \n",

      "This document focuses on Sterling Bank’s corporate Policy for Information Security. Specific \n",
